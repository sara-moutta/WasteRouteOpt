## 🎯 Methodological Overview

This framework implements a sector-based Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) optimization approach for municipal solid waste collection systems.

Large urban service regions are decomposed into operational sectors, and a guided local search metaheuristic is applied independently to each sector, reducing computational cost while preserving solution quality.
